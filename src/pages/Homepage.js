								Hello! My name is Cedric, and I enjoy{" "}
								<em>creating things and solving problems</em>. My interest for the
								web started in early 2021 when I decided to teach myself the
								fundamentals of web development.
							</p>
							<p>
								Using Codecademy and every resources I could find, I managed to get
								a foot in. But it's only after getting into the bootcamp{" "}

								</em>{" "}
								that my learning really rocketed (pun intended ðŸš€). In 10 weeks, I
								learned so much starting back from pure JavaScript to creating
								servers in Node, making entire websites from scratch using React and
								even <em>coding a mobile app for a small startup</em> with React
								Native.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now my goal is to find a Apprenticeship and graduate from{" "}
								<em>ETNA</em> where I'm starting my Bachelors Degree in Computer
								Science in March 2022.
