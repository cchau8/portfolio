								Hello! My name is Cedric, and I enjoy{" "}
								<em>creating things and solving problems</em>. My interest for the
								web started in early 2021 when I decided to teach myself the
								foundations of web development.
							</p>
							<p>
								Using Codecademy and every resource I could find, I managed to get a
								foot in. But it's only after dropping my Masters Degree and getting
								into the bootcamp{" "}

								</em>{" "}
								that my learning really escalated. In 10 weeks, I learned so much
								starting back from pure JavaScript to creating servers in Node, make
								full on websites from scratch using React and even{" "}
								<em>coding a full mobile app for a small startup</em> with React
								Native.
							</p>
							<p>
								Now my goal is to find a Apprenticeship and graduate from{" "}
								<em>ETNA</em> where I'm starting my Bachelor in March 2022.
